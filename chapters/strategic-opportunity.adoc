== Strategic opportunity

In the early 1990's the World Wide Web was created. Few could have predicted that this innovation would eventually lead to companies like Amazon—now valued at 1.76 trillion USD—transforming commerce to the point where products can be delivered to your door with just a few clicks.

A similar revolution is now emerging in the monetary sector. For the first time in human history, individuals and companies have access to "sound money" and can verifiably transact directly via cryptographic proofs without the need for a trusted third party through a decentralized monetary system not under central control.

The Bitcoin Playbook outlines the process by which an organisation can leverage crypto technologies into their business operating model. This forms part of a larger digital transformation that companies will have to partake in to maintain relevance in the evolving economic conditions of today.

In general, when running a company, the corporate strategy should be to:

* Grow reveue and operating income
* Reduce your operating costs
* Grow the assets of the company and investment income
* Create and preserve shareholder value

The operating strategy can be divided into two parts, what we will term: a Balance Sheet Strategy, and a Profit & Loss (P&L) strategy.
Example activities under both these strategies are outlined in the table below:

.Table of example operating strategies for both a Balance Sheet Strategy and a P&L Strategy.
|===
|Balance Sheet Strategy|P&L Strategy

| Convert fiat treasury to Bitcoin
| Mine Bitcoin

| Issue equity and buy Bitcoin
| Buy into Bitcoin ETFs

|
| Accept Bitcoin as a form of payment

| Allow employees to be paid in Bitcoin

=== Conversion of fiat treasury to Bitcoin

On August 11th 2020, MicroStrategy was the first publicly traded company to use Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Additional operating companies followed this pioneer and we count now over 30 listed companies that have invested cash to over 200,000 bitcoins.

As said Michael Saylor, Bitcoin can:"provide the opportunity for better returns and preserve the value of our capital over time compared to holding cash." footnote:[https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-announces-over-1b-in-total-bitcoin-purchases-in-2020/]

There are a variety of additional reasons why a company would add crypto-assets on its balance sheet:

*	Using crypto-assets as an hedge against inflation, thanks to the inverted correlation of this asset class with fiat currencies depreciation
*	Using crypto-assets as an asymmetric risk return (trading)
*	Using crypto-assets for portfolio diversification as this new asset class improves the shape ratio
*	Using crypto-assets for long term investment (store of value) similar to gold

=== Bitcoin Corporate Valuation Methodologies

The emergence of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset has created new challenges in how investors and analysts value companies with significant Bitcoin holdings. Traditional Net Asset Value (NAV) calculations often fail to capture the true economic value of companies holding substantial cryptocurrency reserves, leading to the development of modified Net Asset Value (mNAV) methodologies that better reflect the market reality of Bitcoin-enabled corporations.

==== Understanding Traditional and Modified Net Asset Value

Traditional Net Asset Value represents the difference between a company's total assets and total liabilities, providing a baseline measure of company value. However, traditional NAV calculations may treat Bitcoin holdings at book value or apply conservative accounting treatments that fail to reflect current market conditions and the strategic value of cryptocurrency positions.

Modified Net Asset Value represents an enhanced valuation approach that adjusts traditional NAV calculations to account for the market value of Bitcoin holdings and their impact on company valuation. mNAV methodologies mark Bitcoin holdings to current market prices and may apply premiums or discounts based on factors such as liquidity, holding period, and operational integration.

The importance of mNAV becomes apparent when considering companies like MicroStrategy, where Bitcoin holdings represent a substantial portion of total assets. Traditional valuation methods may significantly undervalue such companies if they fail to properly account for the market appreciation of Bitcoin holdings since acquisition. The mNAV approach provides investors with a clearer picture of the economic value embedded in companies pursuing Bitcoin treasury strategies.

==== Key Components of mNAV Calculations

Several critical factors distinguish mNAV calculations from traditional valuation approaches. First, Bitcoin holdings are marked to current market prices rather than historical cost, providing real-time visibility into the value creation or destruction from cryptocurrency investments. Second, mNAV methodologies often incorporate volatility adjustments and liquidity considerations, recognizing that large Bitcoin positions may trade at discounts to spot prices in distressed market conditions.

The methodology also considers the operational aspects of Bitcoin holdings, including custody arrangements, hedging strategies, and the company's demonstrated ability to monetize Bitcoin positions. Companies with sophisticated Bitcoin operations and proven track records of effective cryptocurrency management may command premiums in mNAV calculations, while those with limited operational capabilities may face discounts.

==== Strategic Metrics for Bitcoin-Holding Companies

Advanced valuation frameworks introduce several key performance indicators specifically designed for Bitcoin-holding corporations. The Bitcoin Yield Metric measures the total return generated from Bitcoin holdings relative to the company's operational cash flows, providing insight into the effectiveness of Bitcoin treasury strategies versus traditional investment approaches.

The Bitcoin Integration Score evaluates how successfully a company has integrated Bitcoin into its broader business operations, considering factors such as payment acceptance, employee compensation options, and strategic partnerships within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Companies with higher integration scores typically command premium valuations as they demonstrate genuine operational transformation rather than speculative investment.

The Liquidity Adjustment Factor accounts for the practical realities of converting large Bitcoin positions to fiat currency, recognizing that institutional-sized holdings may face execution challenges during market stress periods. This factor helps investors understand the true liquidity profile of Bitcoin-heavy corporations and adjust their valuation expectations accordingly.

==== Implementation Considerations for Bitcoin Valuation

Successfully implementing mNAV methodologies requires significant technical expertise and access to real-time market data. Companies must establish robust systems for tracking Bitcoin holdings, monitoring market conditions, and calculating adjusted valuations on a regular basis. The complexity of these calculations has led many organizations to partner with specialized financial technology providers rather than developing internal capabilities.

Companies using mNAV approaches for investor communication must still comply with GAAP or IFRS requirements for financial reporting, which may create discrepancies between reported book values and mNAV calculations. Organizations should establish clear governance frameworks for Bitcoin valuation, maintain transparent communication with investors about methodology changes, and regularly benchmark calculations against market performance.

Having said that, we shouldn't underestimate the numerous inherent risks. We will cover later in this document the key controls (COSO) that corporate/treasury departments should put in place before investing in Bitcoin and other crypto currencies.
