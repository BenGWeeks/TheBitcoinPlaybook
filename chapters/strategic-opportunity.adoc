== Strategic opportunity

In the early 1990’s the World Wide Web was created. Few could have predicted that this innovation would eventually lead to companies like Amazon—now valued at 1.76 trillion USD—transforming commerce to the point where products can be delivered to your door with just a few clicks.

A similar revolution is now emerging in the monetary sector. For the first time in human history, individuals and companies have access to “sound money” and can verifiably transact directly via cryptographic proofs without the need for a trusted third party through a decentralized monetary system not under central control.

This Bitcoin-focused opportunity represents more than just a new asset class. The Bitcoin Playbook outlines how organizations can strategically integrate Bitcoin into their business operating model as part of the broader digital transformation necessary to maintain competitive relevance in today's evolving economic landscape.

In general, when running a company, the corporate strategy should be to:

* Grow revenue and operating income
* Reduce your operating costs
* Grow the assets of the company and investment income
* Create and preserve shareholder value

The operating strategy can be divided into two complementary approaches: a Balance Sheet Strategy and a Profit & Loss (P&L) Strategy. Each approach offers distinct opportunities for Bitcoin integration, as outlined in the table below:

.Table of example operating strategies for both a Balance Sheet Strategy and a P&L Strategy.

|Balance Sheet Strategy|P&L Strategy

| Convert fiat treasury to Bitcoin
| Mine Bitcoin

| Issue equity and buy Bitcoin
| Buy into Bitcoin ETFs

| Accept Bitcoin as a form of payment

=== Conversion of fiat treasury to Bitcoin

On August 11th 2020, MicroStrategy became the first publicly traded company to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset, establishing a precedent that has since been followed by numerous other organizations. Today, dozens of publicly traded companies have collectively invested in hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) leading the way with approximately 580,000 BTC. The table below shows major corporate Bitcoin holders as of 2024-2025, with holdings subject to change based on company strategies and market conditions.

Percentages calculated based on current circulating supply of approximately 19.8 million BTC. Companies engaged primarily in Bitcoin mining may hold additional operational Bitcoin not reflected in treasury totals.*

As Michael Saylor noted, Bitcoin can“provide the opportunity for better returns and preserve the value of our capital over time compared to holding cash.” footnote:[https://www.microstrategy.com/en/company/company-videos/microstrategy-announces-over-1b-in-total-bitcoin-purchases-in-2020/]

Companies consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet for several strategic reasons:

* Inflation hedge: Bitcoin's finite supply provides protection against fiat currency depreciation
* Asymmetric risk-return profile: Potential for significant upside with defined downside risk
* Portfolio diversification: Bitcoin's low correlation with traditional assets improves overall portfolio performance
* Store of value: Long-term wealth preservation similar to gold, but with superior portability and divisibility

Having said that, we shouldn’t underestimate the numerous inherent risks. We will cover later in this document the key controls (COSO) that corporate/treasury departments should put in place before making any Bitcoin investment decisions.
