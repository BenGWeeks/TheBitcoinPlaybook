== Execution

The implementation of a Bitcoin strategy, as per MicroStrategy’s roadmapfootnote:[Microstrategy, Bitcoin (BTC) initiative - project roadmap, February 2021], can be divided into the following phases:

- *Assessment*: Conduct a thorough assessment of the company’s current financial and operational posture, as well as its risk tolerance, to determine the feasibility and potential impact of adopting a Bitcoin strategy. This assessment should consider factors such as the company’s investment goals, risk tolerance, and regulatory requirements, as well as its existing technology infrastructure and internal capabilities. This step is crucial in ensuring that the company has a clear understanding of the opportunities and challenges associated with a Bitcoin strategy and can make informed decisions about its implementation.

- *Education*: Ensure that all relevant stakeholders, including management, employees, and investors, have a strong understanding of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology. This may involve providing training and resources, as well as engaging with industry experts, to help educate and inform the company about the potential benefits and risks associated with this new technology.

- *Due Diligence*: Conduct a thorough evaluation of the various Bitcoin exchanges, custodians, and other service providers, as well as a review of relevant laws, regulations, and best practices. This step is critical in ensuring that the company selects a vendor that is secure, reliable, and compliant with relevant laws and regulations, as well as best practices for the management of digital assets.

- *Implementation*: Work with the selected vendor(s) and partners to establish a secure and compliant infrastructure for holding and managing Bitcoin. This may involve opening a new corporate wallet, executing transactions, and establishing reporting and reconciliation processes. The implementation phase is critical in ensuring that the company has the necessary technology and operational infrastructure in place to support its Bitcoin strategy.

- *Monitoring*: Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance of the Bitcoin strategy and make any necessary adjustments to ensure alignment with the company’s goals and risk tolerance. This may involve monitoring the performance of the Bitcoin portfolio, conducting regular risk assessments, and adjusting the investment strategy as needed.

- *Communication*: Develop and implement a comprehensive communication plan to keep all relevant stakeholders informed and engaged, including regular reporting on the performance and progress of the Bitcoin strategy. This may involve providing regular updates to management and employees, as well as providing transparent and accessible reporting to investors and other stakeholders.

- *Risk Management*: Establish a robust risk management framework, including monitoring, reporting, and contingency plans, to ensure the safety and security of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. This step is critical in mitigating the potential risks associated with a Bitcoin strategy, including market volatility, technological risks, and regulatory risks.

The above steps provide a roadmap for the implementation of a Bitcoin strategy, inline with the Bitcoin Playbook, and will help ensure a successful and compliant adoption of this innovative technology. However, it is important to note that the pace and scope of the implementation will vary depending on the company’s specific circumstances, risk tolerance, and regulatory environment. It is essential that the company regularly reviews and updates its strategy to ensure that it remains aligned with its goals and objectives, and that it is able to adapt to changing market conditions and regulatory requirements.
