== Regulation & Taxation

=== Cryptocurrency regulations in the U.K.

The United Kingdom has taken a proactive approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, recognizing the potential benefits of digital currencies as well as the associated risks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is the primary regulatory body responsible for overseeing the cryptocurrency industry in the UK.

Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the UK are required to register with the FCA and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. This ensures that exchanges have appropriate measures in place to prevent illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing.

In addition, the UK government has introduced the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which requires cryptocurrency exchanges to report suspicious activity to the authorities and to implement strong AML measures. The 5AMLD also requires that cryptocurrencies be subject to the same regulations as other financial instruments, further strengthening the regulatory framework for digital currencies in the UK.

The UK government has also made it clear that it does not consider cryptocurrencies to be a viable alternative to traditional currencies, and has warned consumers about the potential risks associated with investing in digital currencies. However, it has also recognized the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, and has taken steps to support the development of these industries in the UK.

The FCA has also introduced guidelines for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), which are a type of crowdfunding campaign that involves the issuance of digital tokens in exchange for investment. ICOs are subject to the same regulatory requirements as traditional securities offerings, and the FCA has emphasized the need for ICOs to be transparent, fair, and appropriately disclosed to investors.

In conclusion, the UK has taken a balanced approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, recognizing the potential benefits and risks of digital currencies. The regulatory framework in place provides appropriate protections for consumers and investors, while also supporting the growth and development of the cryptocurrency industry in the UK.

=== Cryptocurrency regulations in the U.S.

Cryptocurrency regulation in the United States is complex and evolving, with multiple agencies having jurisdiction over various aspects of digital currency. The primary regulators of cryptocurrency in the US are the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

The SEC views cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities and has taken a cautious approach to regulation, requiring companies to register offerings and comply with disclosure requirements. The CFTC, on the other hand, has classified cryptocurrencies as commodities and has jurisdiction over the trading and futures markets.

The IRS has issued guidance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies, stating that they should be treated as property for tax purposes. This means that cryptocurrency transactions are subject to capital gains tax and that individuals and businesses must report their cryptocurrency holdings and transactions on their tax returns.

FinCEN has jurisdiction over anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) and has issued guidance on the requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges and other service providers to comply with AML/CFT regulations.

In conclusion, cryptocurrency regulation in the US is complex and multifaceted, with multiple agencies having jurisdiction over various aspects of digital currency. Companies operating in the cryptocurrency space must navigate this complex regulatory landscape, comply with disclosure requirements, and adhere to AML/CFT regulations.

=== Accounting classification of cryptocurrencies in the U.K.

The accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies is again a complex and evolving area, and there is no universally accepted accounting standard for these assets. In the United Kingdom, accounting standards are set by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) and overseen by the Financial Reporting Review Panel (FRRP).

In general, cryptocurrencies are classified as intangible assets in the UK, in line with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This means that they are recorded on the balance sheet at their cost, and are subject to impairment testing to determine if they have suffered any permanent loss of value.

Cryptocurrency transactions, such as buying and selling, are accounted for as either investments or operating activities depending on the nature of the transaction. For example, buying cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment would be recorded as an investment, while buying cryptocurrencies for the purpose of making payments would be recorded as an operating activity.

The accounting for cryptocurrencies is complex and challenging, and there is still ongoing debate among accountants and auditors about the best approach. For example, there are questions about how to account for the volatility of cryptocurrencies, and how to determine the value of cryptocurrencies for financial reporting purposes.

In addition, there are also tax implications to consider, as cryptocurrencies are subject to capital gains tax and value-added tax (VAT) in the UK. This means that companies must be mindful of their tax obligations when buying and selling cryptocurrencies, and must accurately record these transactions for tax purposes.

In conclusion, the accounting classification of cryptocurrencies in the UK is still an evolving area, and companies must stay up-to-date with the latest accounting standards and guidance. It is important to work with a qualified accountant who is familiar with the accounting treatment of cryptocurrencies to ensure that financial statements accurately reflect the nature of these assets and transactions.

=== Accounting classification of cryptocurrencies in the U.S.

Corporate treasury departments are facing many challenges regarding the rules and policies of the core competencies of crypto-assets and to one extent its necessary controls.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are often referred to a new asset class as they represent a new type of value, a new payment method and more commonly a new way to store value. However financial authorities across the world categorize them differently ranging from commodity, FX currency, “digital property”, derivative and even sometime as a none financial asset.

In the United States alone, the U.S. Treasury classifies Bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission categorizes Bitcoin as a commodity, and the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) associates it as an asset. This explains why the guidance in US GAAP does not currently directly address the accounting for cryptocurrencies, meaning that crypto are neither cash or a cash equivalent, nor financial instrument, nor inventory.

In its 2018 paper footnote:[Deloitte, Classification of Cryptocurrency Holdings, July 9 2018], Deloitte identified Bitcoin as indefinite-lived intangible asset under an accounting classification called ASC 350. The accounting treatment could be either inventory (if held for sale, see ASC 350: intangibles Goodwill and others) or investment (if held for a financial asset, see ASC 946: financial services - investment companies or alternatively ASC610: other income) upon how the companies classifies its Bitcoin activities.

In the same vein, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has decided on October 21 2020 not to add a project on accounting for cryptocurrencies lacking an accounting definition as a consequence. IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) has provided no specific accounting guidance either. footnote:[KPMG, Blockchain and digital currencies challenge traditional accounting and reporting models, July 18 2018]
