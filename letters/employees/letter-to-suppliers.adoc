Dear Sir/Madam,

Subject: Request to Enable Bitcoin Payments

I am a customer of yours, and I am writing to express my preference for using Bitcoin as a payment method for my payments.

Bitcoin and the Lightning network offer several advantages, such as lower transaction fees, enhanced security, and quicker processing times.
By accepting Bitcoin, your company can benefit from these features, potentially reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

I understand that integrating a new payment system can be challenging.
However, many companies worldwide are adopting Bitcoin due to its growing popularity, practical benefits, and adoption as legal tender by countries such as El Salvador.
Accepting Bitcoin could place your company at the forefront of this financial innovation, potentially attracting a broader customer base.

If you are interested in having Bitcoin as part of your digital strategy, I would like to point you in the direction of the Bitcoin Playbook (ref: link:https://github.com/BenGWeeks/TheBitcoinPlaybook[https://github.com/BenGWeeks/TheBitcoinPlaybook]).
The Bitcoin Playbook offers open-source documentation that interprets and details integrating Bitcoin into your business, a strategy first pioneered by MicroStrategy.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am excited to hear back from you and hope to continue supporting your company with the added convenience and flexibility that Bitcoin payments offer.

Sincerely,

`[Your Name]` +
`[Your Contact Information]`
