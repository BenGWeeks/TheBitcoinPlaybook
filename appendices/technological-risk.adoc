*_Description_*:

Technology risk is any potential for technology failures to disrupt the company business such as information security incidents or service outages. 
There are different underlying blockchains supporting different crypto-assets.
This has an impact in term of decentralisation of governance, resilience of the blockchain and its operating model / consensus mechanism.
Specific IT practices need to be in place to address data management and data privacy.

_Decentralisation of governance_: Public blockchains are usually decentralized by nature.
However certain blockchain/protocol use governance tokens for decision making, and we saw some attempts to buy/loan those governance token (via flash loans) in an attempt to influence the voting/governance.

_Resilience of the blockchain_: For instance, Ethereum had multiple outages in the past due to congestion of its blockchain related to DeFi transaction around CryptoKitties or DeFi protocols.
It tranlasted in service being unavailable for hours.

_Consensus mechanism_: For instance, Bitcoin is decentralized by design but the four biggest miners involved in Bitcoin proof of work mechanism represents more than 50% of the hash power of all the minors. In other terms, if they were to collude, they could maliciously manipulate the ledger. 

_Fork_: In the past Blockchain saw a duplication of its blockchain, called forking, implying a division of its community. It was the case with Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.

_Other technical risks_: blockchain involved other type of attacks such as DDOS attack, 51% attack, Sybille attack on a nodeâ€¦ not to mention the risk of seeing its wallet being hacked or just losing the private key (an equivalent of losing a pincode of its wallet)

*_Mitigants_*:

Overall, we recommend well established blockchain such as Bitcoin with clear governance and proven resilience as Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked or down since its inception.
Having tech savvy employee is also a must and/or companies should involve external consultants.

=== Research Methodology Notes

- Focus exclusively on Bitcoin technology (not general blockchain/crypto)
- Prioritize proven, battle-tested technologies over experimental solutions
- Evaluate technology vendors based on institutional-grade requirements
- Consider both technical and operational aspects of technology risks
- Analyze real-world incidents and lessons learned from other institutions
- Include quantitative risk assessments where possible
- Validate technical assumptions with Bitcoin technology experts
- Consider long-term technology evolution and upgrade paths
- Document all technical dependencies and single points of failure
